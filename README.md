    - single choice type fields, such as profession, diet, gender, body type, etc.
    - multiple choice data, including languages spoken, etc.
    - We will try to predict whether someone has a profession in the 
    STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) using a 
    random sample of the overall dataset.

* Fairly useful tool to preview HTML docs *without* having to clone the repository
* Right-click the \*.html file, copy the link, then go [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/), paste the GitHub specific HTML link


### Sad But True

#### Stu's Looping Rules for R
1. Always use a vectorized solution over iteration when possible, otherwise ... go to #2.
2. Use a functional. Since R is a functional language and for readability, usually of the `apply()` family, or a loop-wrapper function, unless ...
    1. **modifying in place:** if you are modifying or transforming certain subsets (columns) of a data frame.
    2. **recursive problems:** whenever an iteration depends on the previous iteration, a loop is better suited because a     functional does not have access to variables outside the present lexical scope.
    3. **while loops:** in problems where it is unknown how many iterations will be performed, while-loops are well suited and preferred over a functional.
3. If you must use a loop, ensure the following:
    1. **Initialize new objects:** prior to the loop, allocate the necessary space ahead of time. Do NOT "grow" a vector on-the-fly within a loop (this is terribly slow).
    2. **Optimize operations:** do NOT perform operations inside the loop that could be done either up front of applied in a vectorized fashion following the loop. Enter the loop, do the bare minimum, then get out.

### Memory Usage and `rsample`:
The [rsample](https://topepo.github.io/rsample/) package is smarter than you might think.
