# GitHub Repository for [STAA 577](https://stufield.github.io/git-STAA-577)


## Overview
RStudio lab notebooks, full R code, cheat sheets, resources, and 
*ad hoc* notes from "Applied Machine Learning" course Spring 2019.

------------------------

## Why use GitHub?
We have decided to place the course materials in a `GitHub` repository:

1. to familiarize you with this widly used collaborative coding tool
1. so that you will have access to them beyond your tenure at CSU when 
   you venture into the official job market.
   [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) and
   [Jim Hester](https://github.com/jimhester)
   summarize the benefits of `GitHub` in this fantastic reference here:

If you **ever** plan to use verion control with `GitHub` I **strongly**
recommend reading it in detail.

## Previewing HTML on GitHub
* Fairly useful tool to preview HTML docs *without* having to clone the repository
* Right-click the \*.html file, copy the link, then go
[here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/), paste the GitHub specific HTML link

## Stu's Looping Rules for R

1. Always use a vectorized solution over iteration when possible, otherwise ... go to #2.
2. Use a functional. Since R is a functional language and for readability, usually of the `apply()` family, or a loop-wrapper function, unless ...
    + **modifying in place:** if you are modifying or transforming certain subsets (columns) of a data frame.
    + **recursive problems:** whenever an iteration depends on the previous iteration, a loop is better suited because a     functional does not have access to variables outside the present lexical scope.
    + **while loops:** in problems where it is unknown how many iterations will be performed, while-loops are well suited and preferred over a functional.
3. If you must use a loop, ensure the following:
    + **Initialize new objects:** prior to the loop, allocate the necessary space ahead of time. Do NOT "grow" a vector on-the-fly within a loop (this is terribly slow).
    + **Optimize operations:** do NOT perform operations inside the loop that could be done either up front of applied in a vectorized fashion following the loop. Enter the loop, do the bare minimum, then get out.

The [rsample](https://topepo.github.io/rsample/) package is smarter than you might think.
